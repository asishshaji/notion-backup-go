# Prototype Pattern

[Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)

- used for creating a new object out of the previous one
- delegates the actual cloning process to the objects that are being cloned.
    - Why?? Because some attributes of the class might be private, so it makes sense to have the clone method inside the class itself.
- Defines a common interface for objects that want to support cloning
    - Usually, the interface contains only the clone() method.

- An object that supports cloning is called a `prototype`
- Various actors are
    - Prototype Interface, which contains clone() method
    - Concrete Prototype which implements Prototype Interface

- You can also maintain a prototype registry to keep access to frequently accessed prototypes
- Thatâ€™s optional
