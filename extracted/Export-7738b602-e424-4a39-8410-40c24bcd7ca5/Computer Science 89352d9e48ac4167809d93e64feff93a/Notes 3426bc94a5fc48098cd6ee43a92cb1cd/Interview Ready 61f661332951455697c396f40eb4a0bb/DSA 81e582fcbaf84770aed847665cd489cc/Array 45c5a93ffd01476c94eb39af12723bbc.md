- Duplicated values in the sequence

## Techniques

### Sliding Window

[Sliding Window Technique](https://medium.com/@falaycornelius/sliding-window-technique-f8689c05edad)

Sliding window is an extension of the two pointer approach where we use two pointers(left and right) to create a “window”.

The problem will ask us to return the maximum or minimum subrange that satisfies a given condition. Thus the “window” in between our left and right pointers will be that subrange we are looking for.

## Kadane’s Algorithm

[Kadane’s Algorithm — (Dynamic Programming) — How and Why does it Work?](https://medium.com/@rsinghal757/kadanes-algorithm-dynamic-programming-how-and-why-does-it-work-3fd8849ed73d)

> *local_maximum at index i is the maximum of A[i] and the sum of A[i] and local_maximum at index i-1.*
> 

$$
localMaxSum[i] = max(A[i], A[i] + localMaxSum[i-1])
$$

localMaxSum[i-1] can be negative that’s why we select between A[i] and A[i] + localMaxSum[i -1]
