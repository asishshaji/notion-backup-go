# System calls

Interface between a user program and kernel. 

```cpp
BOOL ReadFile(
  [in]                HANDLE       hFile,
  [out]               LPVOID       lpBuffer,
  [in]                DWORD        nNumberOfBytesToRead,
  [out, optional]     LPDWORD      lpNumberOfBytesRead,
  [in, out, optional] LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
);
```

Each system call is associated with a number. A system call interface maintains a table indexed according to these numbers. 

How would you pass arguments to a system call?

- Simplest: pass the parameters in the register
    - parameter can exceed the number of registers
    - But still not so bad solution
- Store in a block, or table, in memory and address of block passed as a parameter in a register
    - Linux and Solaris use this approach.
- Stack-based
    - arguments are placed on the user modeâ€™s stack.
    - The user-mode programs push these arguments onto the stack in a specific order before making the system call.

Both bloc and stack methods do not limit the number of parameters being passed. 

### Microkernel

Near minimum amount of software that provides the mechanisms needed to implement an OS.
