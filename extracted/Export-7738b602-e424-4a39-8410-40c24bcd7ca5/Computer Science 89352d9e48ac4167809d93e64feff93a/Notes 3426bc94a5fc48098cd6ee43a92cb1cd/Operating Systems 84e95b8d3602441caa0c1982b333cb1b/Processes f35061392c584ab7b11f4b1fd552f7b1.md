# Processes

Dynamic execution context of an executing program. A process executes sequentially. 

A process has a state.

- Code
- Static data
- Heap, heap pointer
- Program counter
- Stack, Stack pointer
- Value of CPU registers
- Set of OS resources in use (files)
- Current process execution state (new, ready, running, etc.)

## Execution states

New: When a new process is first started/created, it is in the *new* state. It needs to wait for the process scheduler to set its status to *new* and load it into the main memory from the secondary storage.

Ready: Once the process is loaded to the main memory it enters *ready* state. 

Running: Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the OS scheduler, a context switch is performed and the process state is set to *running*

Waiting: If a process needs to wait for a resource (e.g.: waiting for user input, IO), it is moved to the *waiting* state until it no longer needs to wait - then it is moved back into the *ready* state.

Terminated: Once the process finishes execution, or is terminated by the OS, it is moved to the *terminated* state where it waits to be removed from the main memory.

## Process Control Block

Itâ€™s a data structure in the kernel containing the information needed to manage a particular process. A PCB is created whenever a new process is spawned.

- Keeps track of the execution state and location of each process
- The kernel deallocates the PCB when the process terminates.
- PCB contains pid, register values, state, priority, a pointer to the next PCB, and I/O info (i.e. I/O devices allocated to this process, list of opened files, etc.)

Since PCB contains critical information for the process, it must be kept in an area of memory protected from normal users. 

## Process State Queues

OS maintains the PCBs of all processes in state queues. OS maintains a queue for each of the states. PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process changes, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.

Each I/O device has its own wait queue.

The advantage of having different queues is that the OS can use different policies for getting PCB from different queues.

The size of the running queue is constrained by the number of cores. Why? The number of processes executing at the same time in your machine depends on the number of cores.  The OS scheduler determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues.
