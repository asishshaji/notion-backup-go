# I/O

## Processor- I/O Speed Mismatch

- 1GHz microprocessor can execute 1B load or store instructions per second, or a 4,000,000 KB/s data rate
- Input: device may not be ready to send data as fast as the processor loads it, also, the CPU might be waiting for the user to input the data
- Output: device may not be ready to accept data as fast as the processor stores it

What to do???? 

***Processor checks for the status before acting***. Inside the memory map for the device (memory-mapped i/o), there are two registers: Control and data register.

Control Register has a word which indicates if it’s ready to read/write data.

The Data Register contains the data. 

The processor reads from the `control register` in a loop, waiting for the device to set the `Ready` bit in the control register (0→1). This is called polling.

The processor then loads from (input) or writes to (output) data register. Loading from or storing into the `Data Register` resets the `Ready bit`

(1→0) of `Control Register`.

### Cost of polling!

Assume for a processor with a 1GHz clock it takes 400 clock cycles for a polling operation(call polling routine, accessing the device, and returning). Determine the percentage of processor time for polling.

- Mouse: polled 30 times/sec so as not to miss user movement
- Hard Disk: transfers data in 16-Byte chunks and can transfer at 16 MB/second. Again, no transfer can be missed. (*There is a better solution)

12k clock/s is not bad, we have a 1GHz processor ,ie 10^9 clock/s.

## Alternative to polling

- Wasteful to have the processor spend most of its “spin-waiting” for I/O to be ready.
- Would like an unplanned procedure call that would be invoked only when the I/O device is ready.
- Solution: use an exception mechanism to help I/O. Interrupt program when I/O is ready, return when done with data transfer
- Allow to register interrupt handlers: functions that are called when an interrupt is triggered.
