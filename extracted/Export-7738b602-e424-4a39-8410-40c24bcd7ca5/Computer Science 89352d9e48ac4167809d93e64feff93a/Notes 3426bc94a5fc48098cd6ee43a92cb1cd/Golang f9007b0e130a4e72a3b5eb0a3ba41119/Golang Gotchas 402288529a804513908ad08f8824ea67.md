# Golang Gotchas

[Gotchas in the Go Network Packages Defaults](https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/gotchas-in-the-go-network-packages-defaults/)

The default net library does not set timeouts.

## Client Timeouts

```go
c := &http.Client{
	Timeout: 5 * time.Second,
}
```

This timeout includes any HTTP 3xx redirect durations, the reading of the response body and the connection and handshake times. However, for granular control over these individual properties and more, you need to drop lower to the underlying transport

```go
c := &http.Client{
	Timeout: 5 * time.Second,
	Transport: &http.Transport{
		DialContext: (&net.Dialer{
			// This is the TCP connect timeout in this instance.
			Timeout: 2500 * time.Millisecond,
		}).DialContext,
		TLSHandshakeTimeout: 2500 * time.Millisecond,
	},
}
```

There are `ResponseHeaderTimeout` (time to wait for response headers after request writing ends) and the `ExpectContinueTimeout` (time to wait for a `100-Continue` if using HTTP Expect headers).

## Server Timeouts

You don’t want badly behaving or laggy clients holding your server’s file descriptors hostage. To avoid this, you should always have a customised `http.Server` instance:

```go
s := &http.Server{
	ReadTimeout:  2500 * time.Millisecond,
	WriteTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
}
```

`ReadTimeout` represents the time taken to read the request headers and optionally body, and `WriteTimeout` covers the duration to the end of the response write.

If the server is processing TLS then the `WriteTimeout` ticker actually starts as soon as that first byte of the TLS handshake is read.
