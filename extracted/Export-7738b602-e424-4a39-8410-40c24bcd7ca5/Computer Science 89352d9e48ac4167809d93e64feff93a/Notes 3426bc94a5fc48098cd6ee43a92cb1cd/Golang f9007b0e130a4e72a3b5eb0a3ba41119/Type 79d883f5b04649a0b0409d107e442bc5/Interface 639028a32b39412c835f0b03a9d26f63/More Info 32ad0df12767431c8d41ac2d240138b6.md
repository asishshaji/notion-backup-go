## Pair of Pointers

[GitHub - akutz/go-interface-values: When storing a value in a Go interface allocates memory on the heap.](https://github.com/akutz/go-interface-values/tree/main)

Storing a value in an interface preserves it’s type.

```go
var x int64
var y interface{}
x = 2
y = x

var s string
s = y.(string) // panic: interface conversion: interface {} is int64, not string
var h int64
h = y.(int64) // works
```

We can say that storing a value in an interface preserves the value’s type in some way.

An interface stores 

- an address to the type stored in the interface.
- an address to the value stored in the interface.

There used to be an optimization where a value stored in an interface was stored directly in the last/second word as long as the size of that value's type was smaller than a `uintptr`. However, this optimization was removed in [github.com/golang/go#8405](https://golang.org/issue/8405) due to the introduction of concurrent garbage collection.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	// Store an int64 as an interface value.
	iface := interface{}(int64(2))
	// Get an unsafe pointer for "iface".
	ptrIface := unsafe.Pointer(&iface)
	// Cast the pointer to a *[2]uintptr.
	ptrList := (*[2]uintptr)(ptrIface)
	// Cast the pointer to a *struct{uintptr, uintptr}
	ptrData := (*struct{ ptyp, pval uintptr })(ptrIface)
	// Print the addresses using:
	//   * the builtin println function
	//   * the array of two uintptrs
	//   * the struct with the uintptrs
	println(iface)
	fmt.Printf("(0x%x,0x%x)\n", ptrList[0], ptrList[1])
	fmt.Printf("(0x%x,0x%x)\n", ptrData.ptyp, ptrData.pval)
}

(0x489f00,0x4b8598)
(0x489f00,0x4b8598)
(0x489f00,0x4b8598)
```

`0x489f00`is the address to the type stored in the interface, and `0x4b8598` is the address to the value stored in the interface.

## Underlying type

Every type in golang runtime is represented by 

```go
type Type struct {
	Size_       uintptr
	PtrBytes    uintptr // number of (prefix) bytes in the type that can contain pointers
	Hash        uint32  // hash of type; avoids computation in hash tables
	TFlag       TFlag   // extra type information flags
	Align_      uint8   // alignment of variable with this type
	FieldAlign_ uint8   // alignment of struct field with this type
	Kind_       uint8   // enumeration for C
	// function for comparing objects of this type
	// (ptr to object A, ptr to object B) -> ==?
	Equal func(unsafe.Pointer, unsafe.Pointer) bool
	// GCData stores the GC type data for the garbage collector.
	// If the KindGCProg bit is set in kind, GCData is a GC program.
	// Otherwise it is a ptrmask bitmap. See mbitmap.go for details.
	GCData    *byte
	Str       NameOff // string form
	PtrToThis TypeOff // type for pointer to this type, may be zero
}
```

```go
type _type struct {
	size       uintptr // 8 bytes on a 64-bit platform
	ptrdata    uintptr // 8 bytes on a 64-bit platform
	hash       uint32  // 4 bytes
	tflag      uint8   // 1 byte
	align      uint8   // 1 byte
	fieldAlign uint8   // 1 byte
	kind       uint8   // offset by 23 bytes on 64-bit platforms
}

func main() {
	// Store an int64 as an interface value.
	iface := interface{}(int64(2))

	// Get an unsafe pointer for "iface".
	ptrIface := unsafe.Pointer(&iface)

	// Cast the pointer to a *[2]uintptr.
	ptrList := (*[2]uintptr)(ptrIface)

	t := (*_type)(unsafe.Pointer(ptrList[0]))
	fmt.Println(reflect.Kind(t.kind))
}

int64
```

There is something else interesting about the underlying types, ***they are shared across all interfaces.*** 

```go
func main() {
	println(interface{}(int32(3)))
	println(interface{}(int32(5)))
	println(interface{}(int64(3)))
	println(interface{}(int64(5)))
}
(0x459d80,0x476598)
(0x459d80,0x4765a0)
(0x459dc0,0x476598)
(0x459dc0,0x4765a0)

func main() {
	a, b := int32(3), int32(5)
	x, y := int64(3), int64(5)
	println(interface{}(a))
	println(interface{}(b))
	println(interface{}(x))
	println(interface{}(y))
}

(0x459d80,0xc00003475c)
(0x459d80,0xc000034758)
(0x459dc0,0xc000034760)
(0x459dc0,0xc000034768)
```

- **`0x459d80`**: type address for `int32(3)` and `int32(5)`
- **`0x459dc0`**: type address for `int64(3)` and `int64(5)`

Type information is global and shared by all values stored in interfaces, that’s why we see the same memory address for int32(3), and int32(5). int64(3), int64(5)

- Type addresses are shared
- Value addresses are shared for constants and distinct for variables

```go
package main

func main() {
	a, b := byte(3), byte(5)
	x, y := uint8(3), uint8(5)
	println(interface{}(a))
	println(interface{}(b))
	println(interface{}(x))
	println(interface{}(y))
}
(0x45a240,0x4b89b8)
(0x45a240,0x4b89c8)
(0x45a240,0x4b89b8)
(0x45a240,0x4b89c8)
```

Here we expected the type addresses of a and b  to be the same, and x and y to be the same. The value addresses for a, b, x and y should all be distinct. 

Not only is the address to the type the same for byte and uint8, but the addresses for the values are the same across the types as well.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	x := byte(3)

	// Store x as an interface value.
	iface := interface{}(x)

	// Get an unsafe pointer for "iface".
	ptrIface := unsafe.Pointer(&iface)

	// Cast the pointer to a *[2]uintptr.
	ptrList := (*[2]uintptr)(ptrIface)

	// Get an unsafe.Pointer for the value address offset
	// by the value 197*8.
	ptrY := unsafe.Pointer(ptrList[1] + (197 * 8))

	// Cast ptrY to a uint8.
	y := (*uint8)(ptrY)

	// What is going to be printed?
	fmt.Println(*y)
}

200
```

It turns out that Go defines a special, internal array with exactly 256 elements called [staticuint64s](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/38b2c06e144c6ea7087c575c76c66e41265ae0b7/src/runtime/iface.go#L494). The array holds every possible value (0-255) for an integer that is only one byte wide, such as

- bool
- byte
- int8
- uint8

Thus when it is necessary to create a pointer to one of those values, the Go compiler just addresses an element from the aforementioned array.

What was the point of all this, if x had a value already then what was the need to reference that array?? 

## Copy on store

What is really happening here?

```go
var x int64
var y interface{}
x = 2048
y = x
```

We might be tempted to say that variable x is assigned to variable y. But that’s not accurate.

```go
var x int64
var y int64
x = 2048
y = x
```

Here y is assigned to x. Modifying x later would not affect y.

```go
	var x int64
	var y interface{}
	x = 2048
	y = x
	fmt.Printf("x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y)

	x = 4096
	fmt.Printf("x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y)

x=2048, y=2048
x=4096, y=2048
```

This is because storing a value in an interface results in a copy of that value, just like when assigning a value to another variable of the same type. Even if the value is a pointer, you are creating a copy of that pointer. ***Where do you make this copy???*** 

- Not in the interface itself
- Not in the staticuint64 as the value is greater than 255.

So where is it??? It is in one of two locations, stack or heap.

## Storing a value in an interface results in a copy of that value being created

## On the stack

One of the possible locations for creating a copy is on the stack.

**MOVQ**: used when wanting to copy 8 bytes.

Values escaping to the heap don't always result in a heap allocation.
