GET methods are idempotent and hence good candidates for caching.

When the response is sent back from the server, cache-control headers are set, which tells the intermediate cache servers about the cache configurations.

Exclusive Cache: Separate cache per node(inside the node itself, so has very low latency), can have duplicate data. If routing(intelligent routing) is used we can avoid duplication.

Shared Cache: Nodes share a cache, which lives outside the node. It has higher latency due to the extra hop. It can scale out to a distributed cache.

## Caching related challenges

- Limited cache space
- Cache Invalidation & Cache inconsistency

The effectivity of cache is measured using cache hit

$$
Cache Hit Ratio = Number Of Cache hits/ (NumberOfCacheHits + NumberOfCacheMiss)
$$

CachHitRatio should be higher

---

- Limited cache space
    - Memory is limited. We cannot cache all the data of a data source.
    - The data we cache should be
        - Read-only
        - Frequently accessed objects
        - The size of cache data should be small as possible
            - You have 10 objects to cache, and your cache supports 5 objects
            - The objects that you choose from these 10 objects are the ones with lesser sizes.
- Cache Invalidation & Cache Inconsistency
    - You update the data that you hold in the database, the cache now has invalid data.
    - You can
        - Update the value in the cache after updating the database.
        - Or, You can delete the data from the cache, the next time when someone tries to access it, it will result in a cache miss. This will update the cache.
    - TTL value can be used to remove aged data (Cache invalidation)
        - eg: we can see this in HTTP caching, using cache control header max-age
        - High TTL results in more cache hits
            - Inconsistency interval increases
        - Low TTL decreases inconsistency interval
            - Cache hits go down
