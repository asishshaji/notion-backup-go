# Push Model

## Push Model

[Push vs Pull API Architecture](https://dev.to/anubhavitis/push-vs-pull-api-architecture-1djo)

The simple request-response model is not always applicable for every use case. For example, if the use case is to build a notification service, a request-response model may not be the best option. This is because the client would need to repeatedly ask the server for available notifications, which can be inefficient.

Instead of using a request-response model, you can opt for a push model in this scenario. After establishing a connection from the client to the server, keep the connection open. This way, the client won't have to request data every time.

RabbitMQ uses a push model where the queue pushes messages directly to the workers.

This architecture pushes data upstream over a connection as soon as it becomes available.

One type of push-based transport is called a *websocket*. It is a persistent, bidirectional connection that allows both the client and the server to push data.

Push APIs enable the server to send updates to the client automatically whenever new data becomes available, without requiring the client to explicitly request it. 

When the server receives new information, it automatically sends the data to the client application without requiring a request.

### Why push model

Push APIs are widely used to minimize server load in apps with large user bases and frequent data exchanges or real-time data. Instead of users making frequent requests to stay updated with the newest information, servers instantly push data as new information is obtained.
