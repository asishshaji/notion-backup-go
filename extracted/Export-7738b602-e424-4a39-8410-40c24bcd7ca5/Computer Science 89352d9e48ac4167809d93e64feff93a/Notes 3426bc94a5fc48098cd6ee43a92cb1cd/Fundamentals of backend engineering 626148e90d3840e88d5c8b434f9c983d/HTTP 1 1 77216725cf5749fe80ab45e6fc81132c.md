HTTP 1 doesnâ€™t keep the connection open, which slows things down.

A new tcp connection with each request. It is very slow. You have to send the whole request in one go. There is buffering. You cannot break a big request and send them as chunks. There was no HOSt header.

In HTTP/1.1, keep alive was introduced. Here TCP connections are not closed immediately.

Persisted TCP connection is enabled in HTTP/1.1. It has low latency and low CPU usage. Streaming with chunked feature. Pipelining (Disabled by default).

Pipelining is sending multiple requests at once.

Maintaining order of request in pipelining broke the whole purpose of using it.

HTTP/1.0 did not keep connections open, which slowed things down. A new TCP connection was established for each request, which was very slow. The entire request had to be sent in one go, with no ability to break it up into chunks. There was no "Host" header, and pipelining was not supported.

HTTP/1.1 is a version of the HTTP protocol that introduced several improvements over the previous version. One of the most significant changes was the introduction of keep-alive, which allows TCP connections to persist rather than being closed immediately after a request is completed. This allows for lower latency and CPU usage, as well as support for streaming with the chunked feature. Pipelining is another feature of HTTP/1.1, which involves sending multiple requests at once. However, maintaining the order of requests in pipelining can sometimes break the purpose of using it. Overall, HTTP/1.1 is a significant improvement over the previous version in terms of performance and functionality.
