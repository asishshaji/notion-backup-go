In my last **~9** years of experience, I have worked at **D. E. Shaw**, **Practo**, **Amazon**, and **Unacademy**; and have built systems, services, and platforms that scaled to billions.

Post my masters in CSE from **IIIT Hyderabad** I joined D. E. Shaw for a short stint of 2 months, before moving to Practo and working there as a **Platform Engineer**, building and owning close to 8 different microservices. Post Practo I worked at Amazon on their primary mission-critical E-Commerce Database and built **Data Pipelines** that cold tiered the stale data.

After quitting Amazon in 2018, I joined Unacademy as their first **Technical Architect** and there I designed, built, managed, and scaled services like *Search*, *Notification*, *Logging*, *Deployment Engine*, and many more. I have now transitioned into the role of a Sr. Engineering Manager, leading the Site Reliability vertical.

In January 2020, I started my [newsletter](https://arpitbhayani.me/newsletter) where I write and share an essay about programming languages internals, deep dives on some super-clever algorithms, and few tips on building scalable distributed systems. The newsletter currently has close to **2000+** subscribers.

Recently, I have started building [Revine](https://revine.arpitbhayani.me/) - a programming langauge for kids helping them develop logic through **animations** and spark their creativity through **artwork**.
