# Golang struct tags gotchas

In golang while using struct tag, the spaces make a lot of difference. For example look at the following code.

```
type PodStatus struct {
	Status string `json: ",status"`
}

```

If you run `[go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/)` on this piece of code you will get following error:

```
$ go vet types.go
# command-line-arguments
./types.go:28: struct field tag `json: ",status"`
not compatible with reflect.StructTag.Get: bad syntax for struct tag value

```

Now this does not tell us what is wrong with the struct tag, `json: ",status"`. The problem with this struct tag is that the extra space can be interpreted as delimiter so provide key-value pair without space.

So if the struct changes from:

```
`json: ",status"`

```

to

So the change is just the space after `json:`, now we donâ€™t see the error.
