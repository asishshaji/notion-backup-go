# Builder Pattern

[Design Patterns and Refactoring](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/builder)

- lets you construct complex objects step by step.
- allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- Letâ€™s imagine you need to create an object which has a lot of parameters in its constructor, such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters

- The director accepts the builder, and then the builder builds the object that you want.

[Builder in Java / Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder/java/example)

- Builder interface defines the methods that the concrete builders should follow.
- Concrete builder sets the values

**The key components of the Builder Pattern are:**

- **Product**: Represents the complex object being built.
- **Builder**: Provides an interface for constructing the parts of the product.
- **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface and constructs the parts of the product.
- **Director**: Orchestrates the construction process by using the builder interface.
