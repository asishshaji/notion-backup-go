# Isolation

There are chances when multiple connections are trying to access the same data and neglecting to take care of that can cause huge problems. That’s where isolation comes into the picture.

> ***Perfect isolation ensures that all concurrent transactions will not affect each other. There are several ways that a transaction can be interfered with by other transactions that run simultaneously with it. This interference will cause something we call a `read phenomenon`.***

## Read phenomena

- Dirty reads
    - read something that hasn’t been fully committed (the writer might not have been thoroughly flushed)
- Non-repeatable reads
    - different queries that yield the same value
    - in the second read those values might not be the same.
- Phantom reads
    - things that you cannot read yet.
    - eg: select activities between two dates, if a new value is inserted in between, if you do another select, you get a new phantom read.
- Lost updates
    - I wrote something, but I read it before it was written.

## Dirty Reads

The second concurrent transaction updates the qnt value, so the second read of TX1 will take the new value.

And if we commit the first transaction, the second transaction will roll back to the previous value.

## Non-repeatable read

When a transaction reads the same record twice and sees different values because the row has been modified by another transaction that was committed after the first read.

Here the second transaction is committed much before the first one. 

## Phantom Read

In this case, the same query is re-executed, but a different set of rows is returned, due to some changes made by other recently committed transactions, such as inserting new rows or deleting existing rows which happen to satisfy the search condition of the current transactions query.

## Lost updates

Two transactions start concurrently at the same time. Since both transactions started at the same time, the updates made by one transaction will not show up in the second transaction.

The first transaction increments the qnt value by 10, and thus updating the value to 20. Then the second transaction increments the initial value, since both are isolated. The updated value is not 10 + 5 = 15

Now TX2 commits and if the TX1 run another select query it will get the updated value in the context of the second transaction. Thus TX1 will get an entirely different result.

## Isolation Levels

- **Read uncommitted**: No isolation, any change from the outside is visible to the transaction, committed or not. You can get **dirty read** here, but it is technically fast.

[Everything you need to know about Read Uncommitted Isolation Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiPGbVjl3JY)

- **Read committed:** Each query in a transaction only sees committed changes by other transactions. Each query in a transaction only sees from other committed transactions.
- **Repeatable read:** the transaction will make sure that when a query reads rows, those rows will remain unchanged in the transaction while it's running
- **Snapshot:** Each query in a transaction only sees changes that have been committed up to the start of the transaction. It’s like a snapshot version of the database at that moment. ***This is guaranteed to get rid of all the read phenomena.***
- **Serializable:** Transactions are run as if they are serialized one after the other.
- ***Each database implements isolation levels differently.***

# Summary

Isolation is the result of having the transaction run in isolation from other concurrent transactions.

So that we don't get read phenomena.
