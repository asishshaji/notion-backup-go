# CORS

[](https://itnext.io/understanding-cors-4157bf640e11)

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

When you make an api request from frontend to server, the browser sends an OPTIONS request to the server to get the allowed options (who is allowed to call the API and what type of requests can be sent)

API sends a response with such options. If the frontend app and the request it tries to make are within the allow list, the browser lets it through, otherwise request is rejected, and you will see the error in the console.

![Browser send a preflight request, when the frontend tries to send a request to the API.](CORS%20232e0bb7a0184f189c5335c248863ffa/Untitled.png)

Browser send a preflight request, when the frontend tries to send a request to the API.

![The preflight request, it has OPTIONS as its method.](CORS%20232e0bb7a0184f189c5335c248863ffa/Untitled%201.png)

The preflight request, it has OPTIONS as its method.

To fix CORS error, the server should have a OPTIONS method handler for every request path.

```go
func enableCors(w http.ResponseWriter) {
 // specifies which domains are allowed to access this API
 w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:3333")
 
  // specifies which methods are allowed to access this API
 w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, DELETE")
 
  // specifies which headers are allowed to access this API
 w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Accept, Content-Type")
 
  // specifies for how long the browser can cache the results of a preflight request (in seconds)
 w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Max-Age", strconv.Itoa(60*60*2))
}
```

**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: Defines the url which can access the endpoint. `w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")` for allowing all the clients. 

**Access-Control-Max-Age**: How long the preflight response should be cached for. If the value is zero, the browser won’t cache the preflight request data. The browser will then send preflight request during every request that the frontend makes.

CORS can be bypassed by using http clients like curl, postman etc.

It’s just a protection used by the browser to prevent CSRF. It makes the backend server to accept requests only from your frontend.
