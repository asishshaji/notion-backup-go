# Built-in functions

## New

built-in function that allocates memory, it zeroes memory. new(T) allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type T and returns its address, *T. 

```go
p := new(SyncedBuffer)  // type *SyncedBuffer
var v SyncedBuffer      // type  SyncedBuffer
```

## Make

make(T, args)

It creates slices, maps and channels only and returns an initialized (not zeroed) value of type T (not *T).  The reason for the distinction between these three types represents, under the covers, references to data structures that must be initialized before use. A slice, for example, is a three-item descriptor containing a pointer to the data (inside an array), the length, and the capacity, and until those items are initialized, the slice is `nil`. 

Remember that `make` applies only to maps, slices and channels and does not return a pointer.
