[Chapter II: Interfaces](https://cmc.gitbook.io/go-internals/chapter-ii-interfaces)

Interfaces are implemented as a two-word structure. One for storing type and the other for a pointer to the interface contents.

```go
type iface struct { // 16 bytes on a 64bit arch
    tab  *itab
    data unsafe.Pointer
}
```

An interface is thus a very simple structure that maintains 2 pointers:

- `tab` holds the address of an `itab` object, which embeds the data structures that describe both the type of interface as well as the type of data it points to.
- `data` is a raw (i.e. `unsafe`) pointer to the value held by the interface.

Go’s interface enables [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) (An object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type).

***Interface values are represented as a two-word pair giving a pointer to information about the type stored in the interface and a pointer to the associated data.*** 

```go

type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

func ToString(any interface{}) string {
    if v, ok := any.(Stringer); ok {
        return v.String()
    }
    switch v := any.(type) {
    case int:
        return strconv.Itoa(v)
    case float:
        return strconv.Ftoa(v, 'g', -1)
    }
    return "???"
}

type Binary uint64

func (i Binary) String() string {
    return strconv.Uitob64(i.Get(), 2)
}

func (i Binary) Get() uint64 {
    return uint64(i)
}
```

A value of binary can now be passed to `ToString`, which will format it using the String method.

## Interface Values

Languages with methods typically fall into one of two camps

- Prepare a table for all method calls statically (C++, Java)
- Do a method lookup at each call(Smalltalk, Python, Javascript), and add fancy caching to make that call efficient

Go sits halfway between the two: it has method tables but computes them at run time. 

***The following explanations are based on the assumption that we are dealing with a 32-bit machine.***

`Binary` is a 64-bit integer made up of two words (two 32-bit words).

***Interface values are represented as a two-word pair giving a pointer to information about the type stored in the interface and a pointer to the associated data.*** 

Assigning `b` to an interface value of type `Stringer` sets both words of the interface value.

The ***first word*** in the interface value points to something called itable. The i-table begins with some metadata about the types involved and then a list of function pointers. Itable corresponds to the interface type, not the dynamic type. (interface type, concrete type) pairs. In our example, the itable for Stringer holding type Binary lists the methods used to satisfy Stringer, which is just String: Binary’s other methods(Get) make no appearance in the itable.

### Expanded Code

```go
type iface struct { // `iface`
    tab *struct { // `itab`
        inter *struct { // `interfacetype`, a wrapper around type, describes the type of Interface
            typ struct { // `_type`
                size       uintptr
                ptrdata    uintptr
                hash       uint32
                tflag      tflag
                align      uint8
                fieldalign uint8
                kind       uint8
                alg        *typeAlg
                gcdata     *byte
                str        nameOff
                ptrToThis  typeOff
            }
            pkgpath name
            mhdr    []struct { // `imethod`
                name nameOff
                ityp typeOff
            }
        }
        _type *struct { // `_type`, internal representation of any GO type within the runtime
            size       uintptr
            ptrdata    uintptr
            hash       uint32
            tflag      tflag
            align      uint8
            fieldalign uint8
            kind       uint8
            alg        *typeAlg
            gcdata     *byte
            str        nameOff
            ptrToThis  typeOff
        }
        hash uint32
        _    [4]byte
        fun  [1]uintptr
    }
    data unsafe.Pointer
}
```

The **second word** **in the interface value points to the actual data, in this case, a copy of b. 

Values stored in interfaces might be arbitrarily large, but only one word is dedicated to holding the value in the interface structure, so the assignment allocates a chunk of memory on the heap and records the pointer in the one-word slot.

To check whether an interface value holds a particular type, the Go compiler generates code equivalent to the C expression `s.tab->type` to obtain the type pointer and check against the desired type. If the types match, the value can be copied by dereferencing `s.data`.

To call `s.String()` Go compiler generates code that does the equivalent of C expression `s.tab->func[0](s.data)`. In general, the interface call site doesn't know the meaning of the second word nor how much data it points at. 

Instead, the interface code arranges that the function pointers in the itable expect the 32-bit representation stored in the interface values. Thus the function pointer in this example is `(*Binary)String` not `(Binary)String`.

### Computing the Itable

Now we know what the itables look like, but where do they come from? Go's dynamic type conversions mean that it isn't reasonable for the compiler or linker to precompute all possible itables: there are too many (interface type, concrete type) pairs, and most won't be needed. Instead, the compiler generates a type description structure for each concrete type like `Binary` or `int` or `func(map[int]string)`. Among other metadata, the type description structure contains a list of the methods implemented by that type. Similarly, the compiler generates a (different) type description structure for each interface type like `Stringer`; it also contains a method list. The interface runtime computes the itable by looking for each method listed in the interface type's method table in the concrete type's **method table**. The runtime caches the itable after generating it so that this correspondence needs only be computed once.

In our simple example, the method table for `Stringer` has one method, while the table for `Binary` has two methods. In general, there might be *ni* methods for the interface type and *nt* methods for the concrete type. The obvious search to find the mapping from interface methods to concrete methods would take *O*(*ni* × *nt*) time, but we can do better. By sorting the two method tables and walking them simultaneously, we can [build the mapping](http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/pkg/runtime/iface.c#98) in *O*(*ni* + *nt*) time instead.

## Memory Optimizations

### Optimization 1

If the interface type involved is empty, it has no methods, then itable serves no purpose except to hold the pointer to the original type. In this case, the itable can be dropped and the value can point at the type directly.

### Optimization 2

If the value associated with the interface can fit in a single machine word, there's no need to introduce the indirection or heap allocation. If we define Binary32 to be like Binary but implemented as a uint32, it could be stored in an interface value by keeping the actual value in the second word.

![Untitled](Interface%20639028a32b39412c835f0b03a9d26f63/Untitled%204.png)

If the receiver type fits in a word, it is used directly; if not it is dereferenced. [Untitled](Interface%20639028a32b39412c835f0b03a9d26f63.md) Here the type is dereferenced since the data is not stored in the interface struct.

### Optimization 3

![Untitled](Interface%20639028a32b39412c835f0b03a9d26f63/Untitled%205.png)

Empty interfaces which can hold the data in a word can take advantage of both optimizations.

An interface variable is `nil` until initialized.

```go
var r io.Reader // nil until initialized
var b *bytes.Buffer // nil until initialized

r = b // r is no longer nil, but it has a nil pointer to a Buffer
```

Interface variable is nil only if both parts are nil.

![Untitled](Interface%20639028a32b39412c835f0b03a9d26f63/Untitled%206.png)

b is nil that's why the value part of r’ is nil. Therefore r’ is not nil.

For example, error type is an interface

```go
type error interface {
	func Error() string
}
```
