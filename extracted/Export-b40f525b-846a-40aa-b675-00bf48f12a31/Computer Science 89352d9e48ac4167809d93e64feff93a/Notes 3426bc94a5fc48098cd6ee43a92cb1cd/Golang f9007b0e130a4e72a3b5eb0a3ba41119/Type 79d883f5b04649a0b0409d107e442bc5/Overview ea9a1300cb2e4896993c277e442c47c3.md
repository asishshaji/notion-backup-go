# Overview

17 built-in basic types. 15 out of these are numeric types. 

byte ↔ uint8

rune ↔ int32

Integers whose name starts with an `u` is an unsigned type, their values are always positive.

uintptr, int and unit are full words, i.e. they occupy the word size of the platform. 4 on 32-bit architectures and 8 on 64-bit architectures. 

A string is a sequence of bytes, which is utf-8 encoding representation of the piece of text.

A ***literal*** of a value is a text representation of the value in code. 

for bool `false` and `true` 

```go
0xF// the hex form (starts with a "0x" or "0X")0XF

017// the octal form (starts with a "0", "0o" or "0O")0o17
0O17

0b1111// the binary form (starts with a "0b" or "0B")0B1111

15// the decimal form (starts without a "0")

1.23
01.23 // == 1.23
.23
1.
// An "e" or "E" starts the exponent part (10-based).
1.23e2  // == 123.0
123E2   // == 12300.0
123.E+2 // == 12300.0
1e-1    // == 0.1
.1e0    // == 0.1
0010e-2 // == 0.1
0e+5    // == 0.0
```

```go
// Legal ones:6_9// == 690_33_77_22// == 03377220x_Bad_Face// == 0xBadFace0X_1F_FFP-16// == 0X1FFFP-160b1011_0111 + 0xA_B.Fp2i

// Illegal ones:_69// _ can't appear as the first character69_// _ can't appear as the last character6__9// one side of _ is a illegal character
0_xBadFace// "x" is not a legal octal digit1_.5// "." is not a legal octal digit1._5// "." is not a legal octal digit
```

String values in Go are UTF-8 encoded. In fact, all Go source files must be UTF-8 encoding compatible.
