[Why do databases store data in B+ trees?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09E-tVAUqQw)

Storage structure are of two type mutable and immutable. Imutability is one of the core concepts influencing database design and implementation.

Mutable storage structures use an in place update mechanism. During insert, update or delete operation the records are updated directly in the target file.

# Why B-tree

There are multiple other solutions like Binary Search Tree, AVL tree etc

### Binary Search Tree(BST)

BST

In BST following the right tree gives you the max key in the tree. Following the left tree gives you the min key in the tree.

Then what’s the problem with BST?? ***Unbalanced Tree.*** Insert operations don’t follow any specific pattern. Element insertion might lead to a situation where the tree is not balanced.

Here the second tree looks very similar to a linked list. If the tree becomes unbalanced, it’s going to be very difficult to search. In the second scenario instead of a logarithmic complexity, you get a linear time complexity. The tree needs to [be balanced](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/balanced-binary-tree/). Without balancing you lose all the performance benefits of a BST.

You can balance the tree, by performing a rotation step after every insertion or deletion.

This increased maintenance cost makes BST an impractical candidate as an on-disk data structure.

### Problems

- No locality, because of elements added in random order and also due to rotation
    - There is less probability that a newly added node is close to its parent
- Since binary trees have a fanout of 2, height = binary logarithm of # of elements, we will have to do O(log2 N) disk seeks to find the element.
    - They make an efficient in-memory database, but the low fanout makes them an impractical candidate for external storage.

### Inference

- High fanout for a great locality
- Low tree height for reducing disk seeks.

On-disk data structures are used when the data is so large that you need to store it on external storage. Only a fraction of data can be cached at a time, and the rest of the data has to be stored on an external storage in a manner that allows efficient access.

Pages are between 2 to 16Kb, and a block can contain 64 to 512 pages.

The smallest unit that can written/read is a page. 

Writing only full blocks, and combining subsequent writes to the same block, can
help to reduce the number of required I/O operations.

The smallest unit of disk operation is a block. To follow a pointer to the specific location within the block, we have to fetch an entire block. Since we already have to do that, we can change the layout of
the data structure to take advantage of it.

***B-Trees combine these ideas: increase node fanout, and reduce tree height, the number of node pointers, and
the frequency of balancing operations.***

B-trees are built on top of the foundations of BST. They have a higher fanout and smaller tree height.

Keys inside B-Tree Node are sorted, so we can make use of the binary tree to find the key you are looking for.

```
		 [1,   4,   9]
     /     |     \
    v      v      v
[1, 2, 3] [4, 6] [9, 11, 12]
```

### Rules for creating B-Tree

- At least half of the node must be filled before creating the child
- Root can have min two children
- All leaves at the same level
- The creation process is bottom-up

## B-Tree balancing

- If a node is too large to fit on one page, it is split into two nodes.
- If a node is too small, try merging it with a sibling.
