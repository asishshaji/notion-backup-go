# Websockets

Websockets are a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. This protocol is designed to be used in web browsers and web servers, allowing bidirectional communication and real-time updates.

Websockets are essential for real-time applications, such as chat applications, multiplayer games, and financial platforms. With websockets, developers can create interactive and dynamic web applications that provide a seamless user experience.

To establish a websocket connection, a client sends an HTTP request with an "Upgrade" header to the server. The server responds with a HTTP 101 status code, indicating that the connection has been upgraded to a websocket connection. Once the websocket connection is established, both the client and server can send data to each other at any time.

Websockets are more efficient than traditional HTTP requests because they allow data to be sent without the overhead of HTTP headers. This reduces the latency of the application and makes it more responsive.

In conclusion, websockets are an essential technology for modern web applications. They allow developers to create real-time, interactive applications that provide a seamless user experience.

Websockets enable bidirectional communications on the web. HTTP1.0 closed TCP connections immediately. HTTP1.1 kept the connections open (keep alive).

So this keep-alive lead to keeping connections open, this opened opportunity for websockets.

Connection is opened and a handshake is made.
