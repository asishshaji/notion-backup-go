# Reading and Sending data

## Send and Receive buffers

- The kernel actually creates 4 queues(SYN, Accept, Send and Receive Buffer)
- Client sends data on establishing connection, ie writes to socket file descriptor.
    - NIC receive the frame, frame is parsed as IP packet and is given to the OS.
    - Segment has the port. And the data is put in receive queue.
    - Kernel acks and update the window.
    - Client sends more data
    - If the buffer is full, kernel drops the data
- Therefore backend application should call read() quickly to remove the data from the buffer
- App calls read to copy the data from the receive buffer into its process memory.
- The data is encrypted. Itâ€™s the job of backend application to decrypt the data not the kernel.
- Now the app reads the request.

When you want to write the response back, you call send() function from your backend application. This writes the response into the send buffer. The response is encrypted raw bytes.
