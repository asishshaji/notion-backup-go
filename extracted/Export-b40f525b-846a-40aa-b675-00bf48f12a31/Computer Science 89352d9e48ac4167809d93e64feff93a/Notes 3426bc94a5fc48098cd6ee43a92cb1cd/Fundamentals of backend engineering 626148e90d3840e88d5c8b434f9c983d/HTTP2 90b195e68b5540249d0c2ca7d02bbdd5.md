# HTTP2

HTTP/2 is the second major version of the HTTP protocol widely used on the internet. It was released in 2015 as an update to HTTP/1.1, which had been in use since 1999. HTTP/2 is designed to improve website performance by reducing latency and enhancing security.

One of the main changes in HTTP/2 is the way it handles requests and responses. In HTTP/1.1, each request had to be sent individually and sequentially, which led to a lot of overhead and increased latency. In contrast, HTTP/2 allows multiple requests to be sent in parallel over a single connection, reducing the number of round trips needed to load a webpage.

Another improvement in HTTP/2 is the use of binary framing, which replaces the plain text format used in HTTP/1.1. Binary framing allows for more efficient processing of requests and responses and reduces the risk of errors due to parsing issues. HTTP/2 also includes support for server push, which allows servers to send resources to clients before they are requested, further reducing latency.

Overall, HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1 in terms of website performance and security. Many popular web browsers and servers support HTTP/2, and it is widely used on the internet today.

HTTP2 can send multiple requests to the server from the client. Every request is marked with a stream id, so this can solve the issue with pipeline(order issue).
