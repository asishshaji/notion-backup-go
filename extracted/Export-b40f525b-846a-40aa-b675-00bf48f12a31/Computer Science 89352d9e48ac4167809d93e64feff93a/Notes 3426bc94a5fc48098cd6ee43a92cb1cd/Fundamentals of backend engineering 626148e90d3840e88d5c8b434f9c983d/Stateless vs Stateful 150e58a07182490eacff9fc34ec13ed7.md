# Stateless vs Stateful

## Stateful

- Stores state about clients in its memory
- Depends on the information being there

## Stateless

- Client is responsible to “transfer the state” with every request.
- May store but can safely lose it.

**If I crash and restart an application, it will continue to work without any problem.**
