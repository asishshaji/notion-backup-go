**TLS evolved from Secure Socket Layers (SSL)**

TLS does not secure data on end systems. It simply ensures the secure delivery of data over the Internet, avoiding possible eavesdropping and/or alteration of the content.

**TLS is normally implemented on top of TCP** in order to encrypt Application Layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and IMAP, although it can also be implemented on UDP, DCCP, and SCTP as well (e.g. for VPN and SIP-based application uses). This is known as Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)

TLS uses a **combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography**

**TLS uses asymmetric cryptography for securely generating and exchanging a session key.** The session key is then used for encrypting the data transmitted by one party, and for decrypting the data received at the other end. Once the session is over, the session key is discarded.

Symmetric key encryptions are much faster than asymmetric keys.
