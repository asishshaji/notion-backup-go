# Polling

## Short Polling

**Polling** refers to the act of checking for new data at regular intervals by making API calls to the server.

Short polling can be summarized as "the request is taking a while, I'll check with you later.”

This method can be used for an asynchronous service. The client sends a request first, and the server immediately responds with a unique ID. The server can then either send the request to a queue or persist it in some storage.

While the server continues to process the request, the client can check with the backend using the unique ID to check the status of the request. This is called polling.

This is a fairly simple process, but it is very bandwidth-intensive. (chatiness) Multiple time-consuming requests can result in numerous short polling requests, which can become a bottleneck.

## Long Polling

It eliminates the chattiness associated with short polling. Long poll can be summarized as “Request is taking long, I’ll check with you later, but talk to me only when it’s ready.”

Kafka uses long polling. The consumers will connect to the producer, once a message arrives the consumer gets the data.

The backend doesn’t responds until it has a response. 

Long polling is technique where the server elects to hold a client connection open for as long as possible, delivering a response only after data becomes available or timeout threshold has been reached.
