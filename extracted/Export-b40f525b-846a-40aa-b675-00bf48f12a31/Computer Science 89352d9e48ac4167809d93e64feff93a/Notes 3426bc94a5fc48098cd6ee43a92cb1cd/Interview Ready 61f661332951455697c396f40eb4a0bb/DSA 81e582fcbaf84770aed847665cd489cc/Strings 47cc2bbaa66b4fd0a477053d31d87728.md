# Strings

- whenever I see the word “longest/shortest” substring or subsequence, that is an automatic 2 pointers/dp.
- if I see “can this word be made up from these following words” -> trie/dp
- if I see “can this word be modified to become a target word with min moves” -> bfs
- some other common string questions are “can those following words be in the same group” -> either union find or hash
- If question contains the word substring its mostly sliding window
