# Intro

## Network Core

- mesh of interconnected routers
- **packet-switching:** host breaks application layer messages into **packets**
    - network forwards packets from one router to the next, across links on the path from source to destination

## Two key network-core functions

Forwarding or routing and switching

Forwarding: local action, move arriving packets from the router’s input link to the appropriate router output link

Routing: global action, determines the source-destination path taken by the packets

**Forwarding**

When a packet arrives at a router’s input link, the router must move the packet to the appropriate output link. For example, a packet arriving from Host H1 to Router R1 must be forwarded to the next router on a path to H2.

**Routing**

The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths are referred to as routing algorithms. A routing algorithm would determine, for example, the path along which packets flow from H1 to H2.

## Packet switching: store and forward

The entire packet must arrive at the router before it can be forwarded to the next link. [(**Store and forward**)](http://bucarotechelp.com/networking/basics/76082602.asp)

## Packet switching: queuing

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it.

For A and B the transmission rate is 100 Mb/s, and for the router it is 1.5Mb/s. The router here is slower when compared to the speed at which data is received from A and B.

If too many packets arrive at the router at the same time, a queue of packets will form at the router. 

### Packet queuing and loss

If the arrival rate to the link exceeds the transmission rate of the link for some period of time:

- packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on the output link.
- packets can be dropped if the memory in the router fills up.
