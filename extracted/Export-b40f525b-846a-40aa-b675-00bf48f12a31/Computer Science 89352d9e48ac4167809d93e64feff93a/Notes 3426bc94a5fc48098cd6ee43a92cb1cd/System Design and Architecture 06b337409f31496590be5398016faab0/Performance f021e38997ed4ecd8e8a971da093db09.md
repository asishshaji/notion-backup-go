Consider the database to be an RDBMS

Performance measures how fast or responsive the system is under a given workload (Backend data, request volume) or given hardware (kind, capacity). The performance problem results from some queue building somewhere, eg: Network socket queue, DB IO queue, OS run queue etcâ€¦

Reasons for the queue build-up are inefficient slow processing, serial resource access, and limited resource capacity.

## Performance Principles

- Efficiency
    - Efficient Resource Utilisation
        - IO- Memory, Network, Disk
        - CPU
    - Efficient Logic
        - Algorithms
        - DB Queries
    - Efficient Data Storage
        - Data Structures
        - DB Schema
    - Caching
- Concurrency
    - Hardware
    - Software
        - Queuing
        - Coherence
- Capacity

Latency depends on wait/idle time and processing time. Throughput is the rate of requests that a system can handle.
