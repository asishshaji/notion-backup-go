Multiple data query is very common. 

Microservice architecture uses polyglot persistence, therefore we need strategies to manage queries between services.

### How can we manage cross-service queries

- Direct HTTP Communication
    
    Not a good solution, there is more coupling between services
    
- Asynchronous communication
- Materialized View Pattern
    
    Reduces inter-service communication
