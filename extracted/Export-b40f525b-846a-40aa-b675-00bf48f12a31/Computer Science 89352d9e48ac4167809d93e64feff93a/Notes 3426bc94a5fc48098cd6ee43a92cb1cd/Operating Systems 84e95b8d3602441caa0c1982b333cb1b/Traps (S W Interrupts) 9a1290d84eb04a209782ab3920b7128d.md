# Traps (S/W Interrupts)

In OS, the applications depend on the events in order to execute functions. Hence, the OS comes under the event-driven module paradigm. 

A trap is a synchronous interrupt triggered by an exception in a user process to execute functionality. Exception conditions like invalid memory access, division by zero, or a breakpoint can trigger a trap in an OS. Trap changes the mode of OS from user mode to kernel mode. 

Trap handler is synchronous. When the OS detects a trap, it pauses the user process. As soon as the system call is completed, the OS resumes and continues the execution of the user process.

The trap is a signal raised from a user program that indicates the operating system to perform on some functionality immediately while interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware indicating an event that needs immediate attention.

In summary, interrupts are primarily used to handle external hardware events and ensure efficient multitasking, while traps are used for controlled program execution and handling exceptional conditions within the program.

Traps and interrupts are both mechanisms used in computer systems to handle various events and manage the flow of execution. However, they serve different purposes and have some key differences:

1. **Purpose:**
    - **Interrupts:** Interrupts are asynchronous events that occur as a result of external hardware events, such as I/O completion, hardware errors, timer expiration, or external device signals. Interrupts allow the CPU to temporarily suspend the execution of the current task and transfer control to a specific interrupt handler to deal with the event.
    - **Traps:** Traps, also known as exceptions or software interrupts, are synchronous events that are generated by the CPU itself in response to specific conditions, such as division by zero, page faults, or system calls. Traps are typically used for error handling, system calls, and other controlled events within the program's execution.
2. **Source:**
    - **Interrupts:** Interrupts are initiated by external hardware components or devices to gain the CPU's attention and request servicing.
    - **Traps:** Traps are initiated by the executing program or by the CPU itself due to exceptional or intentional conditions encountered during program execution.
3. **Control Flow:**
    - **Interrupts:** When an interrupt occurs, the CPU switches its execution from the current task to the corresponding interrupt handler routine. The original task is often paused or preempted.
    - **Traps:** Traps cause a controlled transition from the current program's execution to a specific trap handler routine. Traps are generally synchronous and are triggered as a direct result of an instruction executed by the program.
4. **Usage:**
    - **Interrupts:** Interrupts are commonly used for managing hardware events, input/output operations, and handling time-sensitive tasks.
    - **Traps:** Traps are used for error handling, system calls, and other situations where the program needs to communicate with the operating system or handle exceptional conditions.
5. **Examples:**
    - **Interrupts:** Examples of interrupts include keyboard input, disk I/O completion, and timer interrupts.
    - **Traps:** Examples of traps include division by zero, page faults, and software-initiated system calls.

In summary, interrupts are primarily used to handle external hardware events and ensure efficient multitasking, while traps are used for controlled program execution and handling exceptional conditions within the program. Both mechanisms contribute to the proper functioning and responsiveness of a computer system.

Traps are essentially a performance optimisation. A less efficient solution is to insert extra instructions into the places where system calls are triggered.
